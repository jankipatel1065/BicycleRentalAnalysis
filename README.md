# Bicycle Rental Analysis üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüìä

## Overview

Explore how different rider types (casual vs. annual members) use bike share services differently through in-depth analysis and visualization.

## Libraries Used

- `tidyverse`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `skimr`
- `tibble`
- `janitor`
- `lubridate`

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Processing Data

- Imported and integrated data from multiple CSV files.
- Converted data types and handled missing values.
- Created new columns for analysis, such as Hour_of_Day, Weekday, Day_of_Month, and Month.

### Step 2: Cleaning Data

- Removed rows with NA values.
- Handled outliers in trip duration.
- Renamed columns for better understanding.
- Sorted and ordered the data.

### Step 3: Analysis/Visualization

- Explored rider type distribution, bike type preferences, and start time tendencies.
- Visualized key insights through various plots and charts.

## Key Insights

1. **Rider Distribution:**
   - 63.62% of riders are annual members, while 36.38% are casual riders.

2. **Bike Type Preferences:**
   - Annual members prefer classic bikes over electric bikes, while casual riders are the only group to use docked bikes.

3. **Start Time Tendencies:**
   - Annual members exhibit consistent start times, likely for commuting, while casual riders have longer average trip durations.
